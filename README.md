# Prometheus on DC/OS

## Great news! The Prometheus framework for DC/OS is available in the catalogue. You shouldn't use this any more!

This repository is the home of the [Prometheus on DC/OS][1] Docker image. 

This image builds on the official Prometheus image ([prom/prometheus][2]). It uses [rq](https://github.com/dflemstr/rq)
to interpret Mesos' [state-summary endpoint][3] and output a [prometheus service discovery][4] file. 

The configuration job runs in the background every minute

This image works out-of-the-box on DC/OS 1.11 and later; for earlier versions of DC/OS you will require the
[Prometheus plugin][5].
